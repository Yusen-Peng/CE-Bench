508,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not show a clear pattern related to a specific thematic or structural feature, indicating randomness or noise."
324,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values show no clear pattern or thematic structure, indicating random activation likely irrelevant to any meaningful feature."
576,Low-level,3,"The activations are moderately concentrated on certain linguistic tokens related to events or changes like 'crisis' and 'crashed', suggesting a potential low-level polysemy pattern, but with some inconsistencies due to varying activation levels on broader terms like 'the'."
411,Low-level,2,"The activated tokens such as 'crashed' and 'during' suggest a vague pattern related to temporal or event-related contexts which could imply low-level semantics, but the consistency is weak due to the presence of less relevant tokens like 'a' and 'The'."
244,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not show a clear or consistent pattern with highly varying token types and relevance levels, and the most activated token is common and uninformative."
761,Low-level,3,"The activations are centered around financial terms suggesting a thematic association, indicating a low-level feature of relevance to finance, with some inconsistencies as 'The' has a high activation without clear contextual relevance."
53,Undiscernible,1,The feature activation values indicate no clear pattern as the tokens do not exhibit an obvious thematic or structural association.
