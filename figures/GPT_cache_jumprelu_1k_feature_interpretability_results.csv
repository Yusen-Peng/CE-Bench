Feature Index,Category,Score,Explanation
389,Undiscernible,1,"The activations show no clear pattern or consistent theme, indicating random or irrelevant associations."
1122,Low-level,2,The feature primarily activates on individual words related to a theme of financial events but lacks a clear or structured pattern across the tokens.
3626,Undiscernible,1,"The feature lacks a clear pattern as the activation levels show high inconsistency, with 'The' having an inexplicably high value compared to other tokens."
1624,Undiscernible,1,"The tokens activated by this feature do not show any clear pattern or thematic consistency, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
3840,Undiscernible,1,The activations show no clear pattern or association as they do not align with a specific low-level or high-level feature and appear random.
5731,Undiscernible,1,"The tokens activated ('market', 'to', 'crisis', 'crashed', 'The') do not appear to have a consistent nor cohesive pattern, indicating noise or irrelevant activations."
3937,High-level,2,"The tokens 'during', '2008', 'market', and 'crashed' suggest a thematic pattern related to a historical market event, indicating a broad theme but lacking a clear structure. 'The' appears as an outlier activation, representing inconsistency."
3479,High-level,3,"The tokens suggest a pattern related to specific events or discussions, such as the global financial crisis, with a focus on specific timeframes or contexts. However, there are inconsistencies, as the token 'The' has a high activation that doesn't clearly fit this pattern."
1750,Undiscernible,2,"The activations do not follow a clear or consistent pattern, indicating a lack of structured theme or clear polysemy, suggesting the feature is likely random noise."
1969,Undiscernible,1,"The tokens activated do not show a clear or consistent pattern, suggesting the feature may represent random noise or irrelevant activations."

3918,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not reveal any coherent pattern or theme among the tokens, indicating a lack of discernible structure or consistent activation."
284,Undiscernible,1,The activations do not show a clear pattern or theme; the inconsistency in activation levels among seemingly unrelated tokens suggests randomness or noise.
2723,Low-level,3,"The feature appears to activate on economically related terms like 'recession', 'crisis', 'crashed', and 'stock', suggesting low-level semantic grouping, but 'The' is an inconsistent outlier, indicating some inconsistency."
