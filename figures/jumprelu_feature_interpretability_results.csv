Feature Index,Category,Score,Explanation
1233,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not show a clear or consistent pattern, and the tokens activated appear random and unrelated."
622,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values show no discernible pattern among the tokens, indicating random or irrelevant activations typical of undiscernible features."
1798,Low-level,3,"The feature appears to activate around financial terminology like 'market', 'stock', and 'crisis', suggesting a thematic cluster. However, the inclusion of '<|begin_of_text|>' and 'Ä ' introduces some inconsistency, indicating it is more likely a low-level, word-level theme with some minor noise."
354,Low-level,2,"The activations seem to focus on specific word-level tokens like 'economic' and 'crisis', suggesting a low-level feature, but the pattern lacks structure and consistency."
1812,Undiscernible,1,"The tokens have varied and low activation values without a clear pattern or strong association, indicating random noise and irrelevant activations."
51,Low-level,2,"The activations focus on economic terms suggesting a theme, but lack a clear structure or strong pattern, as seen in the variation of related terms."
1468,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values show no clear pattern or theme, indicating random or irrelevant activations."
729,Undiscernible,1,"The tokens have low activation values with no clear thematic or structural pattern, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
701,Low-level,3,"The feature seems focused on tokens associated with economic events ('crashed', 'crisis', 'market') suggesting word-level polysemy, but the activation values show some inconsistencies, as '200' doesn't strongly connect with the others."
34,Low-level,2,"The tokens activated ('market', 'economic', 'stock') suggest a broad theme related to economics, but there's a lack of a clear structure or pattern, indicating a low-level feature focused on word-level semantics without strong consistency."
477,Undiscernible,1,The activation values recorded do not show a clear nor consistent pattern related to a specific feature category. Activations seem random and do not demonstrate a coherent theme or pattern across the tokens.

1655,Low-level,4,"The activations are focused on words related to economic themes ('stock', 'crisis', 'economic', 'crashed'), indicating a clear pattern with a possible polysemy at the word level. The token '8' deviates from this pattern but overall consistency is high, suggesting it is a low-level feature."
1146,Low-level,3,"The tokens 'during', 'crisis', 'market' suggest a theme related to contexts or situations but lack clear consistency across examples, indicating some level of word-level topicality with inconsistencies."

1923,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not show a clear pattern or consistent theme; tokens like 'the', 'during', and an isolated number '8' appear, suggesting noise or random activations."
1791,Undiscernible,2,"The activations show a broad theme related to economic terms, but the lack of a clear structural pattern and the presence of only loosely related tokens make it difficult to classify confidently as low-level or high-level."
586,Low-level,3,"The activated tokens are semantically relevant to word-level themes related to instability or disruption, such as 'crisis' and 'crashed', with some minor inconsistencies due to tokens like 'in' and 'during'."

209,Low-level,4,"The feature activates around financial-related tokens such as 'stock', 'market', and 'crisis', indicating a clear pattern related to financial themes with consistent activations and minor deviation at '8'."
1445,Undiscernible,1,The activations appear random with no clear pattern or thematic consistency among the tokens.
987,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not show a clear pattern and seem unrelated, suggesting random noise or irrelevant activations."
195,Low-level,3,"The tokens activated ('economic', 'stock', 'crisis', 'crashed') suggest a theme related to economic turmoil, indicating specificity but with some inconsistencies, as token '8' does not align with the theme. Thus, it fits word-level polysemy with minor deviation."

There is a clear pattern with only slight deviations ('during' could be related contextually). Therefore, it is classified as a low-level feature with a score of 4 for activation consistency."
1666,Low-level,3,"The activations relate to economic contexts ('stock', 'crisis', 'economic'), suggesting a low-level feature focused on economic discourse. However, the presence of '8' with a higher activation value adds some inconsistency, lowering the monosemanticity score."
1659,Low-level,3,"The tokens suggest the feature is associated with concepts around financial difficulties, with '8', '200', 'stock', 'crisis', and 'crashed' indicating possible financial number patterns or crises vocabulary.

1619,Undiscernible,1,"The feature shows extreme activation at the beginning of the text token boundary, which is likely noise, and lacks a coherent pattern among other tokens."
1002,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values show no clear pattern or relevant theme among the tokens, primarily dominated by the <|begin_of_text|> token."
762,Undiscernible,1,"The activation data shows no clear pattern or consistency among the tokens, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
