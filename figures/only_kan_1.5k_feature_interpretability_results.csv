Feature Index,Category,Score,Explanation
1445,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values show no clear or consistent pattern among the tokens, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
95,Undiscernible,1,"The feature shows no clear pattern or consistent activation associated with any meaningful group of tokens, indicating random or irrelevant activations."

768,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values are low and show no clear pattern, indicating the activations are likely random noise."
13,Low-level,3,"The activations show a focus on economy-related terms, indicating polysemy at a word level. Although there is an overall pattern relating to economic contexts, the inclusion of 'The' causes a slight inconsistency."
1465,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values show no discernible pattern and seem random, indicating a feature that is likely noise or irrelevant."
539,Undiscernible,1,"The activations on common tokens and punctuation, such as 'the', 'in', 'The', and '.', show no discernible pattern or clear relevance, indicating random noise."
