739,High-level,3,"The tokens suggest a pattern related to significant events or topics, such as financial or global crises, indicating a broad, high-level thematic categorization. However, the pattern isn't entirely consistent, as not all tokens strongly align with a single recognizable theme, reflecting some inconsistencies."
153,Undiscernible,1,"The tokens show no clear thematic or structural consistency, suggesting random or irrelevant activations."
421,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not show a clear or consistent pattern, with various common tokens being activated similarly, indicating noise or irrelevant activations."
42,Undiscernible,2,"The activations are related to different contexts such as 'recession', 'market', and 'crashed', lacking a clear structural or consistent pattern, pointing towards random or irrelevant activations."
305,Undiscernible,1,"The activations across tokens do not show a discernible pattern or clear relevance, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
544,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not form a clear pattern, as the tokens activated are common and unrelated, suggesting noise."
61,Low-level,2,"The activations are focused on individual words with no clear pattern of high-level structure, suggesting word-level polysemy. However, there lacks a strong consistency or structure indicating a specific theme beyond individual words, hence the score of 2."
625,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not reveal a clear pattern or theme. The tokens are common and seemingly unrelated, showing no strong coherence."
578,Low-level,2,"The activations centered around tokens like 'crashed' and 'leading' suggest a loose theme related to actions or events, but the inclusion of common tokens like 'the' and prepositions indicates a lack of clear structure."
506,Low-level,5,"The feature activates strongly for tokens related to financial terms, indicating a clear low-level word association pattern with no deviating examples."
393,Undiscernible,1,"The activations are spread across unrelated tokens like 'leading', 'global', 'The', 'to', and 'recession', showing no discernible pattern or consistent theme, indicating random noise."
102,Low-level,2,"The feature seems to focus on terms related to economic downturns, such as 'recession' and 'crisis', but lacks a clear structure or consistency beyond that broad theme."
332,Low-level,4,"The activations primarily concern specific financial terms and a time reference, indicating a consistent theme related to financial events. The presence of a comma as a deviation suggests a minor inconsistency, but overall the pattern is clear and relevant to financial contexts."
110,Undiscernible,1,The activations show random relevance across different tokens without a discernible pattern or theme.
158,Low-level,3,"The tokens such as 'in', 'during', '2008', 'leading', and 'crashed' suggest a pattern related to time-based or event-related contexts, indicating a low-level word-level polysemy feature. However, there is some inconsistency, as 'crashed' is more event-specific while others relate to time or sequence, hence the score."
175,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not exhibit any clear or consistent pattern, appearing random and without structure."
532,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not exhibit a clear or consistent pattern, as different, seemingly unrelated tokens have similar activation values, suggesting random noise or irrelevant activations."
671,Low-level,3,"The activations suggest a pattern related to a specific context, possibly indicating a low-level feature focused on temporal and economic terms (e.g., 'during', 'recession').

294,Low-level,3,"The activations suggest a focus on specific words like 'crashed', indicating a word-level polysemy pattern. While there is a tendency towards words related to a specific context (e.g., events, actions), there are inconsistencies with other tokens like 'a' and 'leading', hence a score of 3."
346,Low-level,3,"The feature activates on tokens related to economic downturns ('crashed', 'crisis', 'recession'), but also activates on neutral words ('the', 'during'), indicating a clear overall pattern with some inconsistencies."
579,Low-level,4,"The activations are consistent with a theme related to economic events, specifically around the time of economic downturns, given the tokens 'crisis', 'recession', and '2008'. The token 'during' adds context but aligns with temporal aspects, while 'in' is more general. The overall pattern is clear with slight deviation, hence a score of 4."
