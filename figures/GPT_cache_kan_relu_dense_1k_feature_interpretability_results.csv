3556,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not show a clear or consistent pattern across tokens, indicating random or irrelevant activations."
4513,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not show a consistent pattern or theme across the tokens, with 'The' having an atypically high activation that does not fit any clear context; therefore, the feature appears to be random noise."
1943,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not show a clear or consistent pattern and appear random, indicating no discernible relevance among the tokens."
696,Low-level,3,"The activations primarily relate to words associated with financial events, particularly the 2008 market crash. While there is a clear focus on a specific event, the token 'The' has an exceptionally high activation that introduces some inconsistency in the pattern, which might not be directly related to the semantic focus of the feature."
3061,Undiscernible,1,"The feature exhibits no clear pattern or consistent activation across the tokens, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
1935,Undiscernible,1,"The activations appear to be random and lack a clear pattern or structure, with a mixture of high activation values across unrelated tokens."
