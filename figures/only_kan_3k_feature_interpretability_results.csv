1037,Undiscernible,1,"The activations are inconsistent and appear random, with no discernible pattern or broad theme observed."
1680,Low-level,3,"The activations suggest a pattern related to specific words typically associated with finance or events, like 'crashed' and 'stock'. The overall pattern is clear but not without inconsistencies, indicated by the involvement of tokens like 'in'."
1139,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not reveal a clear or consistent pattern, with seemingly arbitrary associations to different tokens such as a number, a word, and punctuation."
