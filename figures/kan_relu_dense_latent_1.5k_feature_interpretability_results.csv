441,Undiscernible,1,"The activations appear random with no discernible pattern, characteristic of undiscernible features."
143,Undiscernible,1,"The tokens activated do not show a clear or coherent pattern, suggesting random noise or irrelevant activations."
296,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not show a clear pattern; they appear random and lack thematic consistency, indicating noise."
645,Low-level,4,"The feature consistently activates around economic terms indicating a possible pattern related to finance, although 'Ä ' shows slight deviation."
1205,Low-level,4,"The activations focus on tokens related to economic terms and actions which implies a low-level semantic association, with a clear pattern and one or two potential outlier activations."
255,Undiscernible,1,"The feature activation data shows no clear or consistent pattern, with random activations across generic tokens and lacks discernible linguistic or semantic coherence."
1798,Low-level,2,"The tokens activated suggest a broad theme related to economic contexts ('market', 'crisis'), but the lack of a strict pattern and inclusion of less relevant tokens ('in', '8', and whitespace) indicate low-level features with minimal structure."
1791,Low-level,2,"The activations revolve around economic terms, suggesting a broad theme related to finance or economics, but the lack of a clear, distinctive pattern and relatively low activation consistency indicate a low-level feature related to word-level polysemy without much structure."
621,Undiscernible,1,"The activations are spread across common tokens like numbers and articles with no clear pattern or theme, indicating random noise and lack of relevance."
71,Low-level,3,"The feature shows activation on tokens related to a specific event ('stock', 'crashed') indicating a potential word-level polysemy, but some inconsistencies ('during', space token) prevent a clearer pattern classification."
2024,Low-level,3,"The feature shows consistent activations around economic concepts but with some inconsistencies, indicating a low-level feature related to words or phrases like 'market' and 'economic'."
1561,Low-level,4,"The activations indicate a pattern related to financial terms, which suggests a low-level feature associated with word-level polysemy. There is a clear pattern with a minor deviation."
