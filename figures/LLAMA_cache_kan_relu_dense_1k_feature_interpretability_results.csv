Feature Index,Category,Score,Explanation
114,Undiscernible,1,"The feature lacks a discernible pattern or thematic consistency as the tokens 'global', 'leading', 'recession', and the text start token do not demonstrate a clear or coherent activation pattern."
1261,Low-level,3,"The tokens 'recession', 'global', and 'crisis' seem related to economic terms, showing some level of thematic consistency typical of word-level polysemy, but the presence of 'to' and 'a' introduces inconsistencies."
1642,Undiscernible,2,The activated tokens do not present a clear or consistent pattern and represent a broad theme without structure.
776,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not show a clear pattern or strong association with a coherent theme, indicating random or irrelevant activations."
64,Undiscernible,1,"The activations show no discernible pattern and appear random, indicating a lack of relevance to any coherent feature."
1834,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not form a discernible pattern related to a specific concept or category, as the scores are low and apply to generic tokens and terms without a clear thematic connection."
2032,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not show a clear pattern or theme, indicating randomness and lack of consistency."
140,High-level,5,"The tokens 'global', 'recession', 'market', and 'crashed' indicate a clear pattern related to economic events, suggesting the feature captures a high-level concept. No deviating examples suggest a strong activation consistency."
1093,Undiscernible,1,"The activations show no clear pattern or theme among the tokens, which vary from grammatical items to verbs and prepositions. This indicates random or irrelevant activations."
939,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not reveal any discernible pattern or theme, indicating random or irrelevant token activation."

788,Low-level,2,"The tokens activated, such as 'market', 'during', and 'crashed', suggest a theme related to events or descriptions. However, the presence of inconsistent tokens like '200' and '.' indicates a lack of a clear structure. This suggests a low-level feature with a broad theme but lacking consistent activation patterns."
