8489,Low-level,3,"The feature likely represents a theme of economic downturns with tokens like 'recession', 'crisis', and 'crashed'. While there is a clear overall pattern, some tokens like 'in' and 'leading' show inconsistencies, suggesting some word-level polysemy."
9072,Undiscernible,1,"The activations show no discernible pattern or clear association with a specific theme, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
15013,Undiscernible,1,"The activations are applied to tokens that do not show a discernible or consistent pattern, appearing to be unrelated without a clear theme indication."
2364,Low-level,3,"The tokens 'crisis', 'global', and 'market' show activation patterns related to economic themes, indicating a low-level feature focused on word semantics. However, some inconsistencies exist, such as the token ',', which does not contribute meaningfully to the identified theme."
