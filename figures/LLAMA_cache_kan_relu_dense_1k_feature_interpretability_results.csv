8489,Low-level,3,"The activations predominantly relate to economic terms ('recession', 'crisis', 'crashed') indicating a pattern. However, the presence of 'in' and 'leading' as activated tokens introduces some inconsistency, but the overall theme of economic events is clear."
9072,Undiscernible,1,"The tokens do not show a coherent or clear pattern, and their activations appear random, suggesting undiscernible feature activation."
15013,Undiscernible,2,"The tokens show a loose connection related to adverse events or outcomes but lack a clear pattern or structure indicating a coherent theme. Hence, it does not fit neatly into low-level or high-level features."
2364,Low-level,4,"The activation data suggest a clear pattern related to financial terms, with slightly varying activations among them. This indicates a low-level feature focusing on word-level polysemy associated with financial contexts, with a minor deviation from complete consistency."
