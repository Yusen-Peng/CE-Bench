1891,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not exhibit a clear pattern or consistent theme across the tokens, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
916,Undiscernible,1,"The feature does not show a consistent pattern of activations related to a specific theme or concept, as the tokens are common and have low activations, suggesting noise or irrelevant activations."
