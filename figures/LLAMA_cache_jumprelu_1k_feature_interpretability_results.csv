Feature Index,Category,Score,Explanation
9807,Undiscernible,1,"The activations show no discernible pattern, with all tokens having a low and similar activation level except the initial token, which does not correspond to a meaningful feature."
4980,Undiscernible,1,"The feature activations are very low and largely zero, indicating no discernible pattern or relevance to any specific tokens."
6936,Undiscernible,1,"The activations are mostly zero, with a small activation for a non-informative token, indicating no discernible pattern."
14083,Undiscernible,1,"The activation data shows no relevant pattern or consistent activations across the provided tokens, indicating random noise or irrelevance."
6583,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values show no clear pattern or relevance; all values are near zero, indicating noise or irrelevant activations."
11195,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not display a clear or consistent pattern, with values being near zero for all tokens, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
8244,Undiscernible,1,"The activations show no discernible pattern related to the tokens, indicating random or irrelevant activations."
4003,Undiscernible,1,"The feature activations are almost zero for all tokens except for a minor activation at the beginning of text token, indicating noise and no discernible pattern."
5439,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not indicate any clear pattern or consistent activation with meaningful tokens. All tokens, except for <|begin_of_text|>, have zero activation, suggesting random or irrelevant activations."
833,Undiscernible,1,"The activations are nearly zero for most tokens, with no clear pattern or consistent activation across them, suggesting irrelevant activations or noise."
15294,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values are all zero except for one isolated token, which suggests random noise or irrelevant activations with no discernible pattern."
5268,Undiscernible,1,"The activation levels show no clear pattern or consistent theme relevant to the tokens analyzed, indicating randomness or noise."
12440,Undiscernible,1,"The feature activation values show no clear pattern or relevance to any specific tokens, indicating random noise and irrelevance."
6500,Undiscernible,1,The activations lack a discernible pattern and do not show a consistent association with any meaningful concept or structure.
6788,Undiscernible,1,"The activations are low across different tokens with no clear pattern, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
14927,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not demonstrate a clear pattern or consistent theme, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
14366,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not form a clear or coherent pattern; they appear to be random and are associated with common or punctuation tokens, indicating noise."
14340,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not exhibit a clear or consistent pattern and appear random, aligning with the characteristic of undiscernible features."
12926,Undiscernible,1,"The activations display no clear pattern and are low, indicating random or irrelevant activations across tokens."
13545,Low-level,3,"The activations show a pattern related to terms tied to economic downturns and impacts, such as 'crashed', and 'recession'. However, there are some inconsistencies with tokens like '200' and 'to', indicating a low-level feature with some noise."
