1950,Undiscernible,1,"The activations show no clear pattern, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
189,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not display a discernible pattern related to either low-level or high-level features. The activations on common words such as 'to', 'the', 'a' and punctuation suggest random noise rather than meaningful linguistic patterns."
1101,Low-level,3,"The activations are related to economic terms (e.g., 'recession', 'market', 'global'), indicating a pattern concerning economics or financial contexts, but there are slight variations in the specific focus, leading to some inconsistencies."
600,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values are low and there is no discernible pattern among the tokens, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
1650,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not form a discernible pattern tied to a specific semantic or syntactic structure, as they are distributed across unrelated tokens such as punctuation and seemingly unrelated words."
1694,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not clearly indicate a consistent pattern, suggesting random noise and lack of relevance to a specific feature."
1093,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values are low and too close together, lacking a discernible pattern. The tokens do not form a clear theme related to a low or high-level feature."
1285,Low-level,4,"The activations show a clear pattern related to economic downturns ('crisis', 'crashed', 'recession'), with two tokens ('during', 'market') slightly deviating but still contextually relevant. This suggests a coherent theme of word-level polysemy concerning economic events."
897,Low-level,3,"The activations show a focus on economic and market-related terms, indicating a low-level feature. However, there are some inconsistencies, such as the activation of 'the', reducing the score."
1167,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values are low and spread across common and unrelated tokens, lacking any clear pattern or thematic consistency."
781,Undiscernible,1,"The tokens with high activations do not show a clear or consistent pattern, indicating noise or random activation rather than a coherent feature."
2020,Low-level,3,"The tokens 'crisis', 'global', 'market', and 'stock' suggest a consistent pattern related to economic or market concepts, which aligns with low-level feature categorization. However, the presence of 'The' as a common article introduces some inconsistency, hence the score of 3."

168,Low-level,3,"The tokens show a pattern related to economic distress (e.g., 'recession', 'market', 'crisis'), indicating word-level polysemy. However, the inclusion of a period as a high activation suggests some inconsistency, thus placing it at a score of 3."
1410,Low-level,3,"The activated tokens ('the', 'global', 'a', '200', '<|begin_of_text|>') suggest relevance to common or general tokens associated with low-level word-level features. There is an observable pattern related to common tokens, yet inconsistencies prevent a higher score."

348,Low-level,3,"The activations show a focus on specific tokens related to economic downturns, like 'recession' and 'crashed', indicating word-level polysemy, but inconsistencies like high activation on 'in' prevent a higher score."
1875,Low-level,3,"The tokens 'market', 'crisis', and 'global' suggest a theme related to economic or global issues, indicating a low-level feature focusing on word-level semantics. However, the presence of generic tokens like ',' and 'Ġ' introduces some inconsistency, reducing the score to 3."

609,Low-level,3,"The tokens 'market', 'global', 'crisis', 'during', and 'crashed' suggest a general theme around economic events, but the pattern is not entirely consistent or specific to a single concept."
297,Undiscernible,1,The activations show no clear pattern and appear random without discernible relevance to a specific linguistic or structural feature.
375,Low-level,4,"The feature appears to activate on economic-related tokens, indicating a pattern related to topics like markets and economy. There is a clear pattern with tokens like 'crashed', 'market', and 'global', with slight inconsistency shown by the activation of common tokens like 'the'."
837,Undiscernible,1,"The activations show no discernible pattern or clear theme; they appear random and inconsistent, indicative of undiscernible features."
540,Low-level,3,"The feature shows a clear pattern related to economic terms, typical of low-level, word-level polysemy. However, the presence of the token 'during', which is more of a function word, introduces some inconsistency in the pattern."
