911,Undiscernible,1,"The tokens have varying words with no discernible pattern or theme, as indicated by the highest activation on an article and random associations with 'global', 'market', and connectors like 'to', suggesting noise."
5529,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not form a clear pattern with the given tokens. The range is broad, with 'The' having a significantly higher activation than others, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
2912,Undiscernible,1,"The feature activation data does not exhibit a discernible pattern, with highly varying activation levels and no clear thematic link between the tokens."
10,Undiscernible,1,"The activations do not show a consistent pattern; the tokens are not semantically related and vary widely in context, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
4155,Low-level,2,"The activations seem to relate to a broad theme of negative economic events, such as 'crashed' and 'recession', indicating low-level, word-level polysemy. However, the pattern lacks strong structure, given the varying relevance of tokens such as 'The'."
3306,Undiscernible,1,"The tokens activated (global, crisis, crashed, 2008, The) do not demonstrate a clear or consistent pattern, resembling random or irrelevant activations. The high activation of 'The' particularly suggests lack of specific semantic relevance."
3310,Undiscernible,1,"The activations appear random with no clear pattern relating to either low-level or high-level features, and the consistently high activation for 'The' suggests noise rather than meaningful activation."
77,Undiscernible,1,"The activations appear random and do not show a clear pattern. Tokens range from common words to specific dates, showing no consistent theme or structure."

2357,High-level,3,"The tokens 'crashed', 'crisis', 'global', and '2008' suggest an association with topics related to global financial events, potentially hinting at a high-level feature like economic discussions or crises. However, the unusually high activation for 'The' introduces some inconsistency, preventing a stronger score."
3805,Low-level,3,"The activation primarily focuses on the token 'crashed' with significantly higher activation, suggesting a word-level importance. However, other tokens like 'market', 'a', and 'to' have lower and more varied activations, indicating some inconsistencies, although a general theme seems present around word relevance."
