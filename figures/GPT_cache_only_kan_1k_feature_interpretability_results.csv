Feature Index,Category,Score,Explanation
348,Low-level,5,"The feature shows a consistent activation pattern related to economic contexts, indicating word-level polysemy, which aligns with low-level features."
47,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values show no clear pattern or thematic structure across the tokens, suggesting randomness or noise."
97,Undiscernible,1,"The activations lack a consistent theme or pattern and appear random, indicating no discernible association with a coherent feature."
147,Undiscernible,1,"The activations lack a clear or consistent pattern, resembling random noise rather than indicating a specific low-level or high-level feature, leading to a classification as undiscernible with the lowest consistency score."
677,Low-level,4,"The activations focus on tokens related to economic conditions and events (e.g., 'crisis', 'recession', 'crashed'). While 'to' does not fit this theme, the majority suggests a word-level polysemy related to economic downturns, fitting a low-level feature with a clear pattern and one deviation."
764,Low-level,3,"The feature shows activation across tokens like 'economic', 'market', and 'leading', which indicates a thematic connection related to economic terms, albeit with some inconsistencies, such as the inclusion of common punctuation like a comma."
532,Low-level,3,"The tokens activated ('crashed', 'The', 'during', 'global') suggest a focus on common or word-level details, indicating a low-level feature. There is a loose overall pattern related to general language components, although with some inconsistencies and no strong theme."
393,Low-level,3,"The feature shows a tendency to activate around tokens that suggest specific themes or contexts, like 'recession', 'global', and 'leading', indicating word-level polysemy. While these activations suggest a broad relationship to economic contexts, there are inconsistencies, such as 'The'."
618,Low-level,3,"The feature shows activation towards tokens related to finance ('market', 'stock'), indicating a theme but with some inconsistencies due to activations on non-thematic tokens like punctuation and 'The'."
647,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not collectively form a clear pattern or consistent theme across the tokens. The activations appear random or lack meaningful structure, indicative of a low monosemanticity score."
580,Low-level,3,"The activations suggest a theme related to events or times, possibly polysemous tokens like 'crashed' and '2008'. There is a clear pattern, but the inclusion of terms like 'to' and 'during' introduces some inconsistencies indicative of low-level feature processing."
638,Undiscernible,1,"The activations given do not form a clear pattern or cohesive semantic theme, indicating noise or irrelevant activations."

204,Undiscernible,2,"The activations lack a coherent pattern as they are spread across generic tokens, suggesting an unfocused theme without a clear structure."
195,Low-level,2,"The tokens exhibit a broad theme related to economic or market contexts ('crashed', 'leading', 'market'), but the pattern lacks structure and clarity, with some tokens like ',' not fitting well."
174,Low-level,4,"The feature predominantly activates around 'economic crisis' and 'leading', indicating a focus on specific word-level concepts related to economic topics, with minor deviations."
131,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values are associated with common connector words, indicating no consistent pattern or theme, resembling random noise."
437,Low-level,3,"The tokens activated relate to economic terms, suggesting a theme around economic conditions. Although 'crashed' shows a stronger activation, the overall pattern has some inconsistencies in activation levels, indicating word-level polysemy."
584,High-level,4,"The tokens show a pattern related to economic themes (e.g., 'recession', 'crisis') suggesting higher-order patterns. There is clear consistency, though with slight variations, hence the score."
152,Low-level,3,"The feature shows an interest in specific tokens related to topics like 'economic' and 'market', indicating a low-level pattern. However, the presence of more generic tokens like 'in' and '.' suggests some inconsistencies."
671,Undiscernible,2,"The activations do not show a clear, consistent pattern and appear somewhat random, suggesting the feature lacks a discernible theme or structure."
352,Low-level,3,"The tokens activated are semantically related to economic downturns, indicating a low-level feature focused on financial difficulties. However, the presence of some inconsistencies in activation levels suggests a clear overall pattern but with some deviations."

91,Low-level,4,"The tokens activated show a clear pattern related to the 2008 global financial events, indicating a low-level feature related to specific economic terms. There's a consistent theme with only minor deviation."
57,High-level,3,"The activations suggest a pattern related to economic events or crises, especially around the 2008 recession. However, there is some inconsistency given the activation of a token like '.' which does not directly relate to the financial pattern, indicating the feature isn't perfectly consistent."
86,Low-level,4,"The feature likely represents a low-level pattern of economic or financial terms related to crises, with a clear pattern but some minor deviations among the tokens."
197,Undiscernible,1,"The activation levels do not show a clear or consistent pattern that aligns with either low-level or high-level features. The tokens appear randomly activated with no discernible relationship, fitting the description of noise or irrelevant activations."

590,Low-level,3,"The activations relate to economic themes ('economic', 'market', 'crashed') and specific events ('2008') suggesting a pattern related to economic events or crises. However, the presence of 'to', a common word, introduces inconsistency, thus the feature seems to reflect a pattern but with inconsistencies."
70,Undiscernible,2,"The activations do not show a clear pattern or strong association to a specific theme or feature. The tokens appear unrelated, indicating a lack of structure."
268,Low-level,4,"The feature shows a strong association with words related to economic downturns, like 'recession', 'crisis', and 'crashed'. Although the clear pattern suggests economic contexts, the token 'during' slightly deviates, indicating a high-level context association. However, the consistency with economic terms classifies it as low-level with some minor inconsistencies."
609,Undiscernible,1,"The activation levels do not suggest a clear pattern or coherent theme, indicating random or noisy activations without relevance to a specific low or high-level feature."
229,Undiscernible,2,"The activations do not demonstrate a clear or consistent pattern, with varying token themes and no cohesive structure."

231,Low-level,4,"The activation values relate to economic downturn themes such as 'crisis', 'recession', and 'crashed', indicating a low-level focus on words related to economic situations with a clear pattern. The presence of '.' and 'stock' fits into the broader economic narrative, with minimal deviation."
