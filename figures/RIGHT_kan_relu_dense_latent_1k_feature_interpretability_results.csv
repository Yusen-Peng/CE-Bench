1709,Low-level,3,"The tokens show a clear relation to financial markets context ('stock', 'market', 'during', 'in') with consistent activations, but the presence of '.' suggests some inconsistency."
1238,Undiscernible,1,"The tokens activated show no clear pattern or consistency and appear to be random, thus classifying it as undiscernible."
907,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not exhibit a clear pattern related to a specific, meaningful feature. The tokens activated seem random, with no discernible theme or structure, indicative of irrelevant activations or noise."
1854,Low-level,3,"The activation data includes tokens like 'crisis' and numbers, suggesting a pattern related to specific contexts or word-level importance. However, the pattern's consistency is moderate, with some variation in the tokens."
157,Undiscernible,1,"The tokens 'crisis', 'market', 'stock', and punctuation '.' show no clear pattern or consistent theme, suggesting random activation likely characteristic of noise."
836,Undiscernible,1,"The activations lack a discernible pattern or theme. Tokens such as 'the', 'economic' and punctuation like '.' do not form any consistent or meaningful grouping, suggesting random or irrelevant activations."
1732,Undiscernible,1,"The feature shows a random pattern of activations without any clear semantic or structural theme, as the highest activations are assigned to generic and unrelated tokens like '.', 'market', and 'economic'."
1812,Low-level,2,"The activations pertain to tokens related to economic terms or market concepts, indicating a low-level feature of economic polysemy. However, the pattern lacks structure and consistency, as the tokens are not strongly associated with a singular clear concept."
