953,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not display a discernible pattern, resembling random noise without clear structure."
1568,Low-level,3,"The tokens such as 'economic', 'market', and 'stock' suggest a theme related to economics or finance, indicating a word-level polysemy. However, the inclusion of 'The', which is a common word with no specific relevance to the theme, suggests some inconsistencies."
1986,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values show no clear pattern among the tokens, suggesting that the feature lacks discernible structure or relevance to a specific pattern or theme."
34,Low-level,3,"The tokens have a semantic relation to economics or market-related themes, indicating a pattern. However, there is some inconsistency observed with tokens like 'in' and '8' which do not clearly fit the economic theme, hence the score of 3."
256,Low-level,2,"The feature exhibits some association with financial-related terms like 'market' and 'stock', suggesting a broad theme. However, the presence of general terms such as 'during', '8', and '200' indicates a lack of structure. Hence, it is categorized as a low-level feature with a score of 2."
866,Undiscernible,1,"The activation levels across tokens like 'during', 'stock', '8', 'economic', and '200' show no clear pattern or thematic consistency, indicating randomness and irrelevance."
1233,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values are low and spread across various tokens without a clear consistent pattern, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
1471,Low-level,3,"The tokens activated suggest a theme related to economic situations or disruptions, though the pattern is not perfectly consistent."
