279,Undiscernible,1,"The activations appear to be random and do not form a consistent or clear pattern, typical of undiscernible features characterized by noise or irrelevant activations."
1933,Low-level,3,"The activations are related to concepts that could potentially form a theme around time and events (e.g., 'during', 'crisis', 'market'). However, the presence of numbers like '8' and '200' introduces inconsistencies, suggesting a pattern but with some deviations."
128,Undiscernible,1,"The activations show no discernible pattern as they are associated with common tokens ('during', 'in') and punctuation ('.'), indicating random or irrelevant activations."
1473,Undiscernible,1,"The activation values do not demonstrate a clear or consistent pattern, with tokens that appear to be unrelated and random, thus lacking discernible structure."
131,Undiscernible,1,"The activations show no clear pattern. The tokens such as '.', 'during', 'economic', 'The', and 'in' are common and unrelated, indicating random noise or irrelevant activations."
