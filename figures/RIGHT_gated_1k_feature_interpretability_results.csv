Feature Index,Category,Score,Explanation
938,Low-level,2,"The feature shows a slight tendency to word-level polysemy with words like 'market', 'crashed', and 'crisis', indicating a theme around financial or economic contexts. However, the activation levels are not strong and consistent enough to show a clear pattern."
